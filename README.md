Hello there. I am so eager to play with you. Before you request me to join your server, I do also have a little request for you to keep. I require an **`Administrative`** priviledge on your server because that helps me to run correctly.<br>
*And if you like me, don't forget to star this repository.*<br>
***So what are you waiting for? Come, let's join the adventure!***
